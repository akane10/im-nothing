# IM NOTHING!!!

`im-nothing` is a cli tool that generate gitignore for ya. why it is called `im-nothing` is because **im nothing**!! like, just dump me, ghost me, ignore me :see_no_evil: :see_no_evil: :see_no_evil: .
Well, of course in this case the `me` is a file/directory. Believe me this has nothing to do with personal life (probably).

But anyway, source gitignore files is from [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

### USAGE

just type something in your terminal like this :

```
$ npx im-nothing <command> <languages>
```

```
command :
add <languages> (to generate gitignore)
list (show all list language available)
exist <languages> (to check whether the languages exist)
help
```

```
example :
$ npx im-nothing add node c java
```
